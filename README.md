A couple of coding challenges solved in Go

## Challenges

[Intersecting values](https://coderbyte.com/editor/Find%20Intersection:Go) - return numbers that occur in both arrays
 
[Bracket Combinators](https://coderbyte.com/editor/Bracket%20Combinations:Go) - return the value of possible outcomes for brackets

Commented out lines of code are either notes, or code that can be swapped for following lines, as either a means to make the code more robust, in the form of error handling or as a means to test the code locally/independently.
